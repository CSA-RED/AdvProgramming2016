Instructions:

You play as Damien, and your goal is to defeat the Nighthawk! Each turn during your battle, you have four options:
<FIGHT> - does a moderate but stable amount of damage
<MAGIC> - has a large range of damage, but the amount fluctuates (this is your "risky attack")
<ITEM> - allows you to use "Lemonade" which will heal you
<RUN> - quits the game
